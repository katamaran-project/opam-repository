synopsis: "Separation logic-based verification of instruction sets"
description: """
Katamaran is a semi-automated separation logic verifier for
the Sail specification language. It works on an embedded
version of Sail called Î¼Sail and verifies separation
logic-based contracts of functions by generating (succinct)
first-order verification conditions. It further comes with a
complete model based on the Iris separation logic
framework."""
